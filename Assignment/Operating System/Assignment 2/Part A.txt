						   2.cd for = change directory
						   3.touch = create a file

                                               1.cat = It will print the data of "file1.txt" and "file2.txt".
											   2.sort = It used for sorting the data in Alphabetical order(a-z).
											   
15. cat file1.txt file2.txt | sort | uniq –d =
                                               1.cat = print the data of given file.
											   2.sort = It used for sorting the data in Alphabetical order(a-z).
											   3.uniq -d = used for to display duplicate sentence.
											   
16. chmod 644 file.txt = chmod used for to change the accessing mode. 
						 644 means, 6 -> owner(r = 2^2, w = 2^1, x =no excute access), 4 -> group(only read access), 4 -> other((only read access).
						 
17. cp -r source_directory destination_directory = It used for to copy the content of from one directory to another directory.

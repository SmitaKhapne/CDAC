Exercise 6    
1. Write a stored procedure by the name of Comp_intr to calculate the amount of 
interest on a bank account that compounds interest yearly. The formula is:-         
I = p (1+ r) y â€“ p    
where:-    
I is the total interest earned.     
p is the principal.           
r is the rate of interest as a decimal less than 1, and    
y  is the number of years the money is earning interest.    
Your stored procedure should accept the values of p, r and y as parameters and insert 
the Interest and Total amount into tempp table.     

ANS:
delimiter //
create procedure comp_intr(p float,r float,y int)
begin
	declare I float;
	declare amount float;
	declare sum float;
	set sum = power((1 + r/100),y);
	set I = p * sum - p;
	set amount = I + p;
	
	insert into ap(amt,prpl) values(amount,I);
end; //
delimiter ;






  
2. Create a stored function by the name of Age_calc.  Your stored function should 
accept the date of birth of a person as a parameter.  The stored function should 
calculate the age of the person in years. The stored function should return the age 
in years.   
ANS:
delimiter //
create function age_calc(dob date)
returns bigint
deterministic
begin
	declare calc bigint;
	set calc = year(sysdate())- year(dob);
	return calc;
end; //


create procedure ageaccept()
begin
	declare x bigint;
	set x = age_calc('2020-10-21');
	insert into age(ag) values(x);
end; //

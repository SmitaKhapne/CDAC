SNIPPER 4

INCORRECT SNIPPET:
					public class Main 
					{
						public static void main() 
						{
							System.out.println("Hello, World!");
						}
					}
					
	
	
Error: Main method not found in class Main, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application


EXPLAINATION:  String[]args in Java i.e. a command line argument array, is used in Java to retrieve input from the console. Whenever JVM try to invoke main method in java then he expect one who has String array as a parameter which is a part of method signature. As main method with expected signature is not define in above class hence we are getting this error.



CORRECT SNIPPET:
					public class Main 
					{
						public static void main(String [] args) 
						{
							System.out.println("Hello, World!");
						}

SNIPPET 1

class Main 
{
   public void main(String[] args) 
   {
     System.out.println("Hello, World!");
   }
}



ERROR : Main method is not static in class Main, please define the method as :
        public static void main(String[] args)
		
		
		
		
EXPLAINATION : If main method is not static then we have to create a object. so without creating a object Main should be accessible from anywhere that's whys we have to declare Main method as a STATIC.
 		
		
		
CORRECT SNIPPET:
class Main 
{
   public static void main(String[] args) 
   {
     System.out.println("Hello, World!");
   }
}

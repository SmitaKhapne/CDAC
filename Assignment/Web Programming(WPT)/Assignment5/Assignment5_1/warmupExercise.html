<!--
    1. Print out "Program started" at the start of your code
    2. Create a Promise that resolves after 3 seconds
    3. Log out the promise while it's pending
    4. Print out "Program in progress..." as well
    5. Print out "Program complete" when the promise completes after 3 seconds

    HINT: Use setTimeout for the delay

    .then() is used to define what happens when the promise resolves.

SNIPPET 2

INCOORECT SNIPPET:
                   public class Main 
					{
						static void main(String[] args) 
						{
							System.out.println("Hello, World!");
						}
					}


Error: Main method not found in class Main, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application



EXPLAINATION: We have to declare main method always as a "PUBLIC" because main method is the entry point in program so it should be accessible from anywhere.



CORRECT CODE:
                    public class Main 
					{
						public static void main(String[] args) 
						{
							System.out.println("Hello, World!");
						}
					}

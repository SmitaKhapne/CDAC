SNIPPET 16

CORRECT SNIPPET:
				public class Main 
				{
					public static void main(String[] args) 
					{
						int num = 10;
						double result = num / 4;
						System.out.println(result);
					}
				}
				
ERROR: no error

EXPLAINATION: Here we expect result 2.5 but we got 2.0. Because when this expression num/4 is evaluated then here we have numerator & denometor both as int data type so result value is also int. Hence, instead of 2.5 we got 2 here. And then this 2 will get assign to result variable which is of type double, hence we see 2.0 in output.

CORRECT SOLUTION:

public class Main 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int num = 10;
		double result = (double)num / 4;
		System.out.println(result);
	}
}

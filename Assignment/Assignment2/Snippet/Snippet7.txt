SNIPPET 7

INCORRECT SNIPPET:
					public class Main 
					{
						public static void main(String[] args)  
						{
							int x = "Hello";
							System.out.println(x);
						}
					}
					
					
ERROR:Incompatible types: String cannot be coverted Int
       int x = "Hello"
                  ^



EXPLAINATION: Here we have x as a int value and we are trying to assign String type value to it. But as java is a strongly type programming language hence it is not allowed us to perform such mistype assignment.
				  
				  
				  
CORRECT SNIPPET:				  
                    public class Main 
					{
						public static void main(String[] args)  
						{
							int x = 10;
							System.out.println(x);
						}
					}

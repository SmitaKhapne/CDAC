SNIPPET 18

INCORRECT SNIPPET:
					public class Main 
					{
						public static void main(String[] args) 
						{
							int a = 10;
							int b = 0;
							int result = a / b;
							System.out.println(result);
						}
					}
					
ERROR:  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmaticException: / by zero at Main.main

EXPLAINATION: Here we will get runtime exception, as in mathematic whenever we divide anything by zero then it result is into infinite.

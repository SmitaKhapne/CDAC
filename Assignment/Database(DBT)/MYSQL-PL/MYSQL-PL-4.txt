1. The CUSTOMER table of a state electricity board consists of the following fields:-    
   
  Meter Number    Varchar    4   
  Meter Type                   Char    1   
              Previous Reading          Int    5   
              Current Reading            Int    5   
              Customer Type              Char    1   
              Last Bill payment          Char    1 (values could be ‘Y’ or ‘N’)   
   
There are two types of meters viz. 3- phase or 1-phase coded as ‘T’ or ‘S’ 
respectively. There are 4 types of customers viz. Agricultural Industrial, 
Commercial and Residential with codes ‘A’ , ‘I’, ‘C’ and ‘R’ respectively.    
   
Formulae:-   
Units used = Current Reading – Previous Reading   Rate 
=Rs.1/ 1.25/ 1.50/ 1.30 for A/I/C/R respectively.   
Amount = rate*units used   
Surcharge = 5% for single phase    
10% for 3 phase   
Excise = 30% of (amount +Surcharge)   
Net = Amount +Surcharge + Excise   
   
Write a block to calculate the bill for each customer. The program should insert the 
Meter no., Units used, Rate, Amount, Surcharge, Excise duty and Net for each 
customer into some other suitable table. Also, at the end, it should insert the total 
Amount, Surcharge, Excise and Net into some other table.

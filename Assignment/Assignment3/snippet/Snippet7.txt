SNIPPET 8

INCORRECT SNIPPET:
					public class Main 
					{
						public static void main(String[] args) 
						{
							int count;

							while (count < 10) 
							{
								System.out.println(count);
								count++;
							}
						}
					}
					
ERROR:  variable count might not have been initialized
        while (count < 10) 
               ^
			   
EXPLAINATION: In that, count variable is not initialized.

CORRECT SNIPPET:
					public class Main 
					{
						public static void main(String[] args) 
						{
							int count = 0;

							while (count < 10) 
							{
								System.out.println(count);
								count++;
							}
						}
					}

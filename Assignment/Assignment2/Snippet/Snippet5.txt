SNIPPET 5

INCORRECT SNIPPET:
                     public class Main 
					{
						public static void main(String[] args) 
						{
							System.out.println("Main method with String[] args");
						}
						public static void main(int[] args) 
						{
							System.out.println("Overloaded main method with int[] args");
						}
					}
					

EXPLAINATION: In this case, we are not getting any error as method overloading is allowed in java. Here JVM will invoke main method having String[] as a parameter. Hence, 1st method get invoked here.
